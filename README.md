# Vehicle Console App üöóüöõüèçÔ∏èüõû

## Description

**Vehicle Console App** is a command-line application (CLI) that allows you to create, manipulate, and delete vehicles, including cars, trucks, and motorcycles. The project is built with **TypeScript** and uses **Inquirer.js** for terminal-based interactivity, storing vehicle data in a JSON file (`vehicles.json`).

## Features

- **Create Vehicles**: Allows the creation of different vehicle types (Car, Truck, and Motorcycle) by entering details like VIN, color, make, model, year, weight, and more.
- **List Vehicles**: Displays all registered vehicles and lets you select one for further actions.
- **Vehicle Actions**: Perform actions like accelerate, decelerate, turn, stop, reverse, and view vehicle details.
- **Delete Vehicles**: Delete vehicles from the system and update the data file.

## Technologies Used

- **TypeScript**: The main language used to build the project.
- **Inquirer.js**: A library to create interactive command-line prompts.
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript/TypeScript code.
- **fs (File System)**: Node.js module for file manipulation (reading and writing to `vehicles.json`).

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have **Node.js** and **npm** (or **yarn**) installed.
